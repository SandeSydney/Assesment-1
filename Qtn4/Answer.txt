Q: What does constructive criticism mean to you?

A:
Contructive criticism according to my understanding is the ability of someone to review something that I have done and is willing to offer their thoughts on how I have done it.
These thoughts don't necessarily have to be pleasing and consoling to massage my ego but they should be truthful and given on grounds that are aimed to make me improve rather than drag me down.
It also matters how I take it. It would be constructive if I choose to delve on solving the presented challenge with the idea of incorporating the critics.
